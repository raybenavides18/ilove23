  <h1>‚ù§Ô∏è I Love You ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
  <p>
    This is the end of this little website, just how we're nearing the end of long distance ü•∫ <br>
    This is our last anniversary we'll have to spend long distance for a good while, and I cannot wait to see you again. I know it's been tough in some parts, but I just know and feel that our love has grown stronger all because of it. I can't wait to be in your presence again, to actually see you with my own two eyes and feel you with my own two hands. Those are senses I have missed all summer long, and I can only revisit them in my dreams. But, it won't be a dream for much longer. The day where we can enjoy each other's love, in-person, is coming, and I know I've said this like five times already, but I seriously cannot wait. But until then, happy 5-months, my love. üíû
