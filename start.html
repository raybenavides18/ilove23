    <h1>Happy 5 months! üíñ</h1>
    <p>Arlette, we're nearing on 3 months of long distance. It's crazy to think that almost the majority of our relationship has been spent with late-night calls, Roblox sessions, and an 8-hour drive between us, because honestly, it really doesn't feel like that. The time we spent together before we had to go long distance had such an impact on my life that it feels so huge compared to the time we've spent apart. Anyways, I thought I'd make you a little something in the form of this! I hope you enjoy, my love.</p>
